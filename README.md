Delighted Services (Online Donation Platform)

Project Goal: Developed an online platform to facilitate the donation of reusable clothing, food, and money by connecting givers with volunteers and local orphanages.

Problem Solved: Addressed the lack of a centralized, efficient online system for coordinating and acknowledging clothing donations in India, moving beyond existing static websites and manual processes.

Key Features & Impact:
Designed a system for fast and easy donation record saving via a database, replacing time-consuming manual file systems.
Implemented a clear form of acknowledgement for every donation and provided a system for easy announcements and updates.
Structured the application using the Waterfall Model and defined four core modules: Registration, Monitoring (for orders/requests), Report (for initiating delivery), and Media (for awareness and updates).
Improved search efficiency and incorporated an identification number system to easily manage and retrieve records for orphans and assistance recipients.
